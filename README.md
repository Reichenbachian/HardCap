## Hardcap
This is a medialabs(3rd party bad captchas) captcha breaker. It used opencv and a bit of python I lost somewhere over the years to automate bitcoin faucets. Upon succesful completion, I informed the company of their weak captchas. They promptly banned my account. They briefly fixed it, but now it's back to how it was.
