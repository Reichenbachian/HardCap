## Hardcap
This is an older one of my projects, and I'm not exactly sure how I implemented it, but this is a captcha breaker. It used opencv and a bit of python I lost somewhere over the years to automate bitcoin faucets. Upon succesful completion, I informed the company of their weak captchas. They promptly banned my account. Now, that hardly seems fair, now does it?
